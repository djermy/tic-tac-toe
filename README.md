# tic-tac-toe

This project is a game of tic-tac-toe, it's the first project I worked on after learning python, git/github and the command line courses on codecademy.com. The project taught me a lot about planning out a grid and how to reference it in the code, as well as the importance of segmenting larger functions into smaller ones and calling them together to make it easier to read and use later.

## How to use

This project is made with python and can be played in the terminal by downloading the script.py file, and run the following in a terminal:
```bash
python script.py
```

## Features

This program includes several key features to allow the player to keep track of the game and allow for smooth operation including:
* Board reference visible at all times.
* Game board visible to show which moves have been taken and which are still available.
* Error messages that inform the player if the input was not valid.
* End game message if the game has reached 9 moves taken.
* Win message informing players when someone wins.
